# kidsteam
## Welcome! 
Thank you so much for considering implementing KidsTeam. The concept of KidsTeam came from Dr. Allison Druin over 20 years ago. Then a professor at the University of Maryland, Druin created a team consisting of children and adults to design technologies for children with children. Over the years, this group has worked with a number of organizations including Nickelodeon, the United States National Park Service, and Carnegie Hall.  

This repository is a collection of resources for those that want to run their own intergenerational design teams. This was originally written for libraries in Baltimore's Enoch Pratt Free Library system to host their own KidsTeams. After putting it together, I realized it would be useful to any organization who wants to include more voices in the design process.

Manual - This is the majority of how to run a session.  
Worksheet - This should aid in putting together one single design session.  
Resources - A list of additional sources to frame KidsTeam and provide additional information on techniques.
