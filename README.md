# kidsteam
==Introduction==  
Thank you so much for considering implementing KidsTeam in your local library. The concept of KidsTeam came from Dr. Allison Druin over 20 years ago. Then a professor at the University of Maryland, Druin created a team consisting of children and adults to design technologies for children with children. Over the years, this group worked with a number of organizations including Nickelodeon, the United States National Park Service, and Carnegie Hall.
