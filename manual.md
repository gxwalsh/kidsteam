# Introduction
Thank you so much for considering implementing KidsTeam in your local library. The concept of KidsTeam came from Dr. Allison Druin over 20 years ago. Then a professor at the University of Maryland, Druin created a team consisting of children and adults to design technologies for children with children. Over the years, this group worked with a number of organizations including Nickelodeon, the United States National Park Service, and Carnegie Hall.

More important than the institutional partners KidsTeam worked with are the children that participated over the years. [TBD]

# Space and Time
The most important parts of determining the space to use is to make sure that it large enough to accommodate the participants in the design sessions. The space should contain a large table that everyone can sit around. It should also contain a large enough floor space that the designers can work in groups on the floor in their activities.

The space should be safe. This means the space should be highly visible from the outside, it should have safety exits in case of emergencies, and access to restrooms. The space should be inviting to children and adults but it shouldn't look like a cliché version of what adults think children would like.

The space should not be a location the children are familiar with in which a power dynamic usually exists. This means that rooms that remind participants of school should be avoided.

An intergenerational design group should meet at a convenient time for both children and adults in the neighborhood. Depending on the focus of your inter-generational design group, you may want to have design sessions weekdays after school during the school year, or on weekends. Design sessions can also occur in the summertime as part of a larger, long-form camp experience at a library.

Design sessions should be no longer the 90 minutes. We have found that anywhere from one hour to 1 1/2 hours is ideal because it allows for enough time to go through all the phases of the design process as well as let the participants really get into the activity. Anything shorter can seem rushed and anything longer runs the risk of all participants losing attention.

We allow children to come and go during the activity much like the library programs we’ve observed over time. 

# Design Sessions
A design session is made up of several phases. These phases work together to address one aspect of a design problem per session. Before a design session begins, you must identify the following things: the design challenge and the question of the day.

## Phase 0: Arrival
Depending on your program, arrival can be treated as an event by itself, or can just be taken for granted if the participants are already at the location. For example, your program may be a once a week program that draws children who are not normally at the library after school. If this is the case, you need to create clear instructions of where parents can drop children off for these programs. You may want to create a sign-in station for children and caregivers to register when they attend. You should need to give clear instructions on where to park, or how to arrive at your location via public transit.

## Phase 1: Snack Time
Snack time is the first phase of the KidsTeam design process. During this time, the entire design team (children and adults) participate by eating the snacks. When choosing snacks, it's important to understand the cultural dietary restrictions for your area as well as any special needs indicated by participants before the design sessions began. Popcorn is an excellent snack because it contains no dairy, is vegan, and has no sugar beyond those naturally occurring in the food. We've had good luck with applesauce, goldfish crackers, Saltines, and granola bars. The easiest drink to serve is water. We've found that children that participate in these design sessions are aware of the environmental damage that plastic plays, so, we suggest you use paper cups and large containers of water or perhaps filtered water from a pitcher.

Before your design team arrives, it is important to set up for snack time. It has been shown that children and adults perform better when they are not hungry. This is one of two reasons we have snack time as part of KidsTeam. Besides feeding the design team, Snack time works as a way to level the power dynamic that both the children and adults are accustomed to especially if the design session is held after school. 

## Phase 2: Circle Time
After about 15 minutes of snack time, it is time for circle time to begin. Much like snack time having two uses, circle time also performs two tasks: continuing to break down power structures, and focusing the discussion on the design problem at hand. 

Ask all of the participants including the adults to sit in a circle on the floor. It's best to break up any groups of friends or siblings. Try to have adults spread out through the circle so that it doesn't seem like they're all sitting together. 

Once everybody is seated, you can announce the question of the day. The question of the day is an open-ended question that is easily answerable by the participants but that has something to do with the focus of the day's design session. For example, if your design session is focused on a new children's space in your library, the question of the day might be "where is your favorite place to read?"

Now that everybody knows the question of the day you can begin doing introductions. The familiarity your KidsTeam has with the process and each other can determine how you want to handle the introductions. Traditionally, each participant says their name their age how many times or how long they've been a participant in KidsTeam and answers the question of the day. It is imperative that the adults use their first names and announced varied as well. Using first names and been open about age is one of the ways in which children come to see the design group as being mortal equal then in school where they use proper titles and the age of adults is rarely mentioned.

## Phase 3: Design Time

Design time is the phase which new ideas are created and prototypes are evaluated. There are an array of multiple techniques that can be utilized in this phase. The techniques used should be kid friendly and enable creative expression butter are also accessible by adults. In most cases, the idea of building and prototyping isn't to create a high-fidelity version of something, instead the idea is to create something that can be explained and iterated upon by other members of the group. You can think of the design phase techniques as a range on a spectrum where one side is generative and on the other side is evaluative.

In our experience, one of the most popular forms of low-tech prototyping is called "bags of stuff". This technique relies on art supplies as well as household objects for intergenerational design groups to build prototypes with. This technique is powerful because it enables children to design new things with materials that they're familiar with from school and at home. In this technique, there's not much training required for the designers because of this familiarity.

Another form of low-tech prototyping popular with both adults and children is drawing. Some adults are self-conscious about drawing and instead will try and write words on paper. It's important to reassure the designers that the quality of the drawing isn't important but instead the story that they're trying to tell. Instead of drawing, groups could use old magazines or advertisements and cut out people and things to use in their designs. Drawing can also be made more engaging by using different types of materials such as large poster boards or rolls of butcher’s paper.

As prototypes move along in the design process it is important to continue to iterate upon those prototypes and the best technique for this is one called "likes, Dislikes, and design ideas". In this technique a prototype is presented to the group the larger design team splits into smaller teams, and using sticky notes, writes either a like, a dislike, or design idea onto a sticky note. Each sticky can only contain one thing and the adult members of the group should help the child members in writing.

There are almost an infinite number of techniques that can be used during the design time phase. For more information we recommend you look at the paper titled FACIT PD.

## Phase 4: Big Ideas
Once the design session is done, it is time to gather the ideas in the big ideas phase. The best way to do this is to have either a white board or a flip chart in one area of the design space. Invite the design teams over to the area by this board and ask for a volunteer to talk about their prototype. Have the group described their prototype and, as they are describing it, a researcher or librarian writes key concepts on the board as they're being described. Each group presents their ideas and it is helpful if each of you each of the groups is represented in a different color.

After all of the groups present their ideas, as a group to discuss what are some of the common ideas between the groups and what are some of the very unique ideas generated by the groups. Sometimes it is helpful if you put symbols next to the ideas and underlined or circle unique ideas.

Once the design session is over and all the child participants have left, it's time for the design group or design researchers to look at the ideas generated in the big ideas phase and collect what's been synthesized on the board. This analysis and synthesis becomes the most important artifact from this design session. In other words, this is the main output for the session.

## Phase 5?: Clean up
This is not an important phase when it comes to the design session, but it is very important when it comes to keeping the space clean. It is helpful to have all of the designers help clean up the space including the art supplies, sticky notes, large pieces of paper, crayons or markers. Space at this time is also extremely helpful to cleanup food or drinks snack time and make sure the space is clean for the next users of that room.
